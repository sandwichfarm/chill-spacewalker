Understood. I'll dig into how Space Walker works on macOS, including what processes it spawns, whether it's possible to bypass its UI via CLI or automation, and how to reliably detect when the Vitcher Pro XR glasses are plugged or unplugged. I'll also look for ways to simulate the "Start" button click in the app programmatically.

I'll get back to you with a proposed setup (likely a combination of a background script and AppleScript or UI automation), including any commands you can try with Claude or other environments to poke into the Space Walker binary.


# SpaceWalker XR Automation on macOS 15.3

## Detecting Headset Plug/Unplug Events

To automate SpaceWalker, the first step is catching when the VITURE Pro XR glasses are connected or disconnected. On macOS, the glasses function as an **external display** (via USB-C DisplayPort alt-mode), so the system registers a new monitor when they're plugged in. There are a few approaches to detect this event:

* **CoreGraphics Display Callbacks:** The most robust method is to use macOS's display reconfiguration callbacks. Apple provides the C API `CGDisplayRegisterReconfigurationCallback` which invokes a callback whenever displays are added or removed. In fact, **automatic detection of display changes is only possible via Objective-C/C APIs like CoreGraphics**, not pure AppleScript. Using this, your code can listen for flags like `kCGDisplayAddFlag` or `kCGDisplayRemoveFlag` in the callback to detect a headset being connected or disconnected. Implementing this in a small background app (Swift/C++) will let you reliably catch plug/unplug events in real time.

* **IOKit Device Matching:** The XR headset likely presents a USB device (for head-tracking sensors) in addition to acting as a display. You can leverage IOKit notifications to watch for the headset's **vendor/product ID** on the USB or Thunderbolt bus. For example, a LaunchDaemon/Agent can specify a matching dictionary (`IOProviderClass` of `IOUSBDevice` or `IOPCIDevice` with the headset's `idVendor`/`idProduct`) to trigger on attach. Apple's launchd supports `com.apple.iokit.matching` events so you can launch a script when a specific device connects. To get the IDs, plug in the glasses and run `ioreg` or check **System Information > USB** (the Viture glasses should appear with a vendor name, and you can note the Vendor ID and Product ID). This approach can directly detect the **USB connection** of the glasses. However, note that if the glasses use pure DisplayPort Alt Mode without a separate USB HID interface, you might rely on the display detection instead.

* **Polling or Third-Party Tools:** If you prefer not to write low-level code, you could use a tool like **Hammerspoon** or **Keyboard Maestro** which can watch display configuration changes. Hammerspoon, for instance, has an `hs.screen.watcher` that triggers a Lua function whenever screens are added/removed. You could have it call a shell script or AppleScript when it detects the Viture display. Keyboard Maestro 9+ also has a "Display layout changed" trigger built-in. These tools handle the event loop for you. As a simpler (but less elegant) fallback, a background script could periodically check the number of displays (e.g. using AppleScript `count of displays` via the Image Events or System Events) and take action when it increases or decreases. Polling is not ideal, but can work if the interval is short.

**Identifying the XR Glasses:** It's wise to ensure the script distinguishes the Viture XR glasses from any other monitor. The glasses' display name might be **"VITURE"** or similar (for example, in Display Preferences or `system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType` output). You can query IOKit for the display's EDID or product name to confirm it's the Viture device. For instance, `ioreg -r -d0 -c AppleDisplay | grep -A10 VITURE` might reveal the display attributes when connected. If no unique identifier is available from the display, using the USB device method (with vendor ID) is more reliable.

## Auto-Launching the SpaceWalker App on Connect

Once a headset connection event is detected, the next step is to **launch SpaceWalker**. This is straightforward: you can script the app launch using the `open` command or programmatically via an API. For example, in a shell or AppleScript:

* **Shell:** `open -a "SpaceWalker"` will launch the app by name (assuming it's in `/Applications`). This is equivalent to double-clicking the app. (You might also use the bundle identifier with `open -b com.viture.SpaceWalker` if known.)

* **AppleScript:** `tell application "SpaceWalker" to launch` will start the app. You may prefer `activate` instead of `launch` if you want it to come to foreground.

Include a slight delay after launching if needed, to give the app time to initialize its UI. SpaceWalker might also prompt for permissions (screen recording permission on first run, etc.), so ensure those are pre-approved to allow automatic launch without dialogs.

**Tip:** SpaceWalker for Mac is designed to automatically default to the last used settings/layout upon launch. This means if the user previously selected a layout and refresh rate, the app will remember them on next launch. So simply launching the app might bring up the last state. However, the user still must hit the **"Start"** button to begin the XR session, which we'll handle next.

## Simulating the "Start" Button Click

The SpaceWalker UI is closed-source and provides no documented command-line interface to start the XR session, so we need to automate the button press. We have to rely on macOS **UI scripting** (Accessibility APIs) to click the "Start" button in the app's window.

**AppleScript UI Automation:** macOS allows AppleScript to interact with GUI elements through the System Events application (if Accessibility permissions are granted). You can script SpaceWalker to press its Start button like so:

```applescript
tell application "SpaceWalker" to activate
tell application "System Events"
    tell process "SpaceWalker"
        click button "Start" of window 1
    end tell
end tell
```

This AppleScript will bring SpaceWalker to the front and simulate a mouse click on the button named "Start" in the first window. (Depending on SpaceWalker's interface, you might need to adjust the hierarchy if the button is nested in groups – use macOS's **Accessibility Inspector** to find the exact UI element path.) Apple's documentation confirms that using the `click` command on a button via System Events will press it just as a user would.

A few important notes for this to work:

* **Enable Accessibility**: Ensure the script (or whichever app runs it) has permission under **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility**. If you're running this AppleScript via a shell (with `osascript`) or a custom app/daemon, that entity needs to be allowed to control the computer.

* **UI Element Names**: The script uses the button's label "Start". If the app is localized or uses a different title, you may need to adjust the string. You can also search by other properties (e.g. an accessibility description) if needed. Tools like the macOS Accessibility Inspector or third-party UI browsers can help identify the button's attributes.

* **Alternate Methods**: If AppleScript is unreliable (for example, if SpaceWalker's UI isn't standard), you could use the **Accessibility API** in a language like Swift/Python to find and press the button via AXUIElement calls. Another workaround some have used is simulating a keyboard press if the "Start" button is the default button (pressing the Return or Space key can activate the default focused button in many apps). For instance, AppleScript `key code 36` simulates the Enter key (key code 36 is Return) which might trigger the default button if "Start" is default. This approach depends on how the SpaceWalker app is built, so GUI scripting the button directly is the more deterministic method.

## Quitting SpaceWalker on Disconnect

When the headset is unplugged, we want to gracefully **exit the SpaceWalker app**. Using the same detection mechanism (display removal or USB disconnect event), trigger a quit routine:

* If using AppleScript: `tell application "SpaceWalker" to quit`. This will attempt to close the app cleanly, allowing it to save state if needed. SpaceWalker doesn't create documents, so it should quit immediately without prompts.

* From the shell: `osascript -e 'tell application "SpaceWalker" to quit'` is one way, or simply `killall SpaceWalker` as a last resort. (Graceful quit is better than kill, to let it release the display and any resources properly.)

It's a good idea to give SpaceWalker a moment to terminate and verify it's closed. For example, you might poll `pgrep SpaceWalker` in a loop for a couple seconds to ensure the process vanishes, or use AppleScript's `quit` command inside a `with timeout of N seconds` block. This ensures the app isn't still running when a quick reconnect happens.

**Display Restoration:** SpaceWalker has a feature to turn off the Mac's built-in display when running (for privacy and to save GPU power). When quitting the app, the internal display should come back on. Usually this happens automatically once SpaceWalker releases its screen capture or display arrangement. If you find the internal screen stays off, you may need to programmatically reset display mirroring or toggle display arrangement (for instance, by issuing a `killall Finder` or using AppleScript to change a display setting) – but in normal use, quitting SpaceWalker should restore the default display state.

## Handling Rapid Disconnect/Reconnect (Race Conditions)

USB-C devices can be connected or removed in quick succession, so our automation must handle **bouncing events** safely. Without precautions, a fast re-plug could, for example, trigger two launches or a launch followed immediately by a quit. Here are strategies to avoid race conditions:

* **Debounce the Events:** Implement a short delay or cooldown for handling connect/disconnect. For instance, when a disconnect event fires, wait a second to see if the device is promptly reconnected before actually quitting the app. Likewise, on a connect, you might wait a moment to ensure the connection is stable (and not a false read or instantaneous unplug). This can be done with a simple timer. Many scripting languages let you schedule a task with a delay (e.g., `sleep 1` in bash, or `NSTimer`/Grand Central Dispatch in Swift).

* **State Tracking:** Keep a global state indicating whether SpaceWalker is currently running or in the process of launching. If a new "headset connected" event comes in but your script knows it already launched SpaceWalker (or is launching it), you can ignore the duplicate event. Similarly, if a "disconnect" comes in but you know you already initiated a quit, suppress extra quits. Essentially, treat it like a tiny state machine (IDLE -> CONNECTING -> RUNNING -> DISCONNECTING, etc.). This prevents overlapping actions.

* **Atomic Operations:** If using a shell script, you can use a lock file or PID check. For example, create a temporary file when launching and remove it after the Start button is clicked, so you don't launch again during that window. In more advanced setups, use thread locks or dispatch barriers if using a multi-threaded approach.

* **Test Extremes:** Simulate rapid plug/unplug cycles to ensure your script doesn't misbehave. For instance, if you unplug immediately after plugging in, the script should ideally cancel the pending launch (if not started yet) or at least quit the app right after launching. If you re-plug quickly, the script might see a disconnect followed by connect – ensure it doesn't quit in the middle of launching. A common pattern is to **queue the events with slight delays**: e.g., on connect, schedule the launch in 0.5s; on disconnect, schedule the quit in 0.5s. If a reconnect happens, cancel the pending quit, and vice versa.

By building in these guards, the automation will be more reliable under real-world use where cables can be jostled.

## Investigating SpaceWalker's Internals

To better script and trust the automation, it helps to understand what SpaceWalker does under the hood when running on macOS 15.3:

* **Processes and Services:** When you launch SpaceWalker, check if it spawns any helper processes or utilizes system services. In Activity Monitor or via terminal (`pgrep -lf SpaceWalker`), you'll typically see the main app process. SpaceWalker might also use macOS system daemons (e.g. it may leverage WindowServer and `VDADecoder` for video, etc., which wouldn't appear as child processes but as system usage). Use `ps -Ajc | grep -i SpaceWalker` to list any process family. It appears SpaceWalker for Mac is a single application process (there's no mention of separate background agents in documentation), so it likely runs entirely in one process. It will of course interface with macOS frameworks (Display, Metal/OpenGL, etc.) internally.

* **Spawned Helpers:** One way to see if SpaceWalker launches sub-processes is to run `sudo opensnoop -p <PID>` or `sudo dtruss -p <PID>` on the running app. These can catch `exec()` calls. Also, running `launchctl list` before and after might show if it registers any LaunchAgents (unlikely). As of now, assume there's just the app itself. (SpaceWalker on iOS/Android has remote service components, but on macOS it's all local.)

* **Command-Line Arguments:** Many GUI apps accept no command-line args or only a few undocumented ones. You can check this by inspecting the binary. Running `strings` on the app binary is a quick way to search for clues. For example:

  ```bash
  strings /Applications/SpaceWalker.app/Contents/MacOS/SpaceWalker | grep -E "^\-\-"
  ```

  This looks for any strings starting with `--` (typical of long flags) or you could grep for the word "usage" or "help". If SpaceWalker had a hidden CLI interface, you might see something like `--headless` or similar in the strings. As an illustration, using `strings` on a binary will output printable text, which can reveal argument names or debug messages. If you find nothing relevant (which is likely), then SpaceWalker doesn't support being controlled via command-line switches in any documented way.

* **AppleScript/Accessibility Control:** Check if the app has a scripting dictionary (though most third-party apps do not). You can try `sdef /Applications/SpaceWalker.app` – if it returns a dictionary, then the app has official AppleScript commands (very unlikely in this case). Assuming none, controlling it will rely on UI scripting as discussed. The good news is macOS's Accessibility API lets you control virtually any GUI element of any app, and we leveraged that for the Start button. You might explore whether SpaceWalker's menu bar icon or menus have options to start/stop the session; if so, you could trigger those via AppleScript (`click menu item "Start" of menu X...`). However, from user reports and the interface design, the primary trigger is that Start button on the main window.

* **Files and Resources:** Inspect what files the app touches. You can use `fs_usage` or `lsof` to monitor this while SpaceWalker is running. For example:

  * Run `sudo fs_usage -w -f filesystem -p <PID>` to watch file system calls. This will show if it's reading configuration files or writing logs. You might see it accessing `~/Library/Application Support/SpaceWalker/...` or `~/Library/Preferences/com.viture.SpaceWalker.plist`. Those could contain user settings. For instance, SpaceWalker "remembers your last used settings" – likely stored in a preferences file.
  * Use `lsof -p <PID>` to list open files and sockets. This can reveal if it's opening any device files. If the glasses have a sensor interface, SpaceWalker might open an HID device. Look in the `lsof` output for anything in `/dev` (e.g., an IOHID device or IOKit user client). You might also see network connections – perhaps SpaceWalker checks for updates or license info. (If you see connections to the internet in `lsof` or via `sudo lsof -i -p <PID>`, that's the app calling home or pulling cloud services.)

* **Libraries and Frameworks:** Running `otool -L /Applications/SpaceWalker.app/Contents/MacOS/SpaceWalker` will list which libraries the app is linked against. This can hint at what technologies it uses (for example, Metal, ARKit, SceneKit, etc.). If you see frameworks like `ARDisplayDevice` or `IOKit`, that means it interfaces with those systems. Also check for any custom driver frameworks bundled inside the app (`/Applications/SpaceWalker.app/Contents/Frameworks`). In SpaceWalker's case, it likely uses standard system frameworks for display and maybe game/graphics (Metal or OpenGL) to render the virtual screens.

In summary, SpaceWalker appears to be a self-contained app that interfaces with the XR glasses via display output and possibly a sensor input. It doesn't expose any official API, so automation relies on monitoring hardware events and manipulating the UI externally.

## Useful Terminal Commands for Binary Inspection

To assist in examining SpaceWalker's binary and runtime behavior, here are some **actionable commands** you can run in a macOS Terminal (preferably in a safe environment, since SpaceWalker is third-party):

* **Find strings in the binary:** This can reveal hidden messages, usage info, or clues about functionality.

  ```bash
  strings /Applications/SpaceWalker.app/Contents/MacOS/SpaceWalker | less
  ```

  Once in the pager, you can search (with "/") for keywords like `Start`, `Error`, `--` (dashes), `VITURE`, etc. For a targeted search:

  ```bash
  strings /Applications/SpaceWalker.app/Contents/MacOS/SpaceWalker | grep -i "start"
  ```

  (Tip: Searching for `"Start"` might show UI text, whereas searching for `"start"` lowercase could catch function names or logs. Case-insensitive `-i` covers both.)

* **List dynamic libraries the app uses:**

  ```bash
  otool -L /Applications/SpaceWalker.app/Contents/MacOS/SpaceWalker
  ```

  This will output all libraries and frameworks the binary links against. Look for any unfamiliar or noteworthy ones. For example, you might see `@rpath/SomeFramework.framework` which could be a bundled proprietary framework. System ones like `QuartzCore`, `IOKit`, `Metal` are expected. (If you spot something like `ARKit.framework` or `SceneKit.framework`, it would indicate AR/VR rendering being used.)

* **Check Mach-O headers for clues:** You can dump verbose info:

  ```bash
  otool -l /Applications/SpaceWalker.app/Contents/MacOS/SpaceWalker | less
  ```

  In there, you might find the app's **entitlements** or minimum OS version. Search for `LC_CODE_SIGNATURE` or `com.apple.security` to see if it has special sandbox permissions. Also search for `__TEXT` or `__info_plist` to find embedded Info.plist sections.

* **Code signature and entitlements:**

  ```bash
  codesign -dvv /Applications/SpaceWalker.app
  ```

  This prints details of the code signature. Adding `--entitlements :-` will show any entitlements. For instance, if SpaceWalker uses hardware like USB, you might see `com.apple.security.device.usb` (though that's more for sandboxed apps, and if not sandboxed it won't appear). You might also see `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` if they load external code, or other interesting flags.

* **Monitor file activity (requires sudo):**

  ```bash
  sudo fs_usage -w -f filesystem -p $(pgrep SpaceWalker)
  ```

  Run this while the app is in use (replace `$(pgrep SpaceWalker)` with the PID or run `pgrep` command as shown). It will show a live log of file operations. Watch for any `.plist` or `.log` files being accessed, which could be config or log files. For example, `fs_usage` might show reads from `.../SpaceWalker/Config` or writing to a log under `~/Library/Logs/`. This can tell you where the app stores its settings. **Note:** `fs_usage` outputs a lot; you can add `| grep SpaceWalker` to filter lines relevant to the app.

* **List open files and sockets (requires sudo for some info):**

  ```bash
  lsof -c SpaceWalker
  ```

  This lists all file descriptors open by any process with name containing "SpaceWalker". It will include files, libraries, network sockets, devices, etc. Check for:

  * `TCP` or `UDP` sockets (to see if it's connected to the internet or listening on a port).
  * Any references to `/dev/` devices (like camera, HID, etc.). For example, an entry like `/dev/cu.usbmodem…` or similar might indicate a direct USB serial connection to the glasses, if applicable.
  * Files under `/Applications/SpaceWalker.app/...` (these are the app's own resources).
  * Files under user library (preferences, caches). E.g., it might use something like `~/Library/Application Support/SpaceWalker/…` or a cache file.

* **Trace system calls (advanced, requires disabling System Integrity Protection if on):**
  If you have a development environment, you could use `dtrace` or the macOS Instrument's "System Trace" to see what the app is doing. For instance:

  ```bash
  sudo dtruss -p <PID>
  ```

  This will trace system calls. You'll see calls like `open()`, `ioctl()`, etc. If you see it calling `IOServiceOpen` or other IOKit functions, that's it talking to drivers (likely for sensor data). `dtruss` is intrusive and may require special entitlements on modern macOS, so consider it optional.

Using the above commands in a controlled environment (or on a test machine) will help you confirm how SpaceWalker operates. For example, you might discover a log line in the `strings` output that says something like "Starting XR session" or an error message if no glasses detected, giving insight into its process. Always be careful when running such tools – they're safe for inspection, but avoid *modifying* anything in the app bundle unless you know what you're doing.

## Recommendations for a Background Automation Service

Putting it all together, here's a roadmap for implementing this as a reliable background service on macOS:

* **Choose the Execution Context:** Since we need to interact with the GUI (to click the Start button), our script or program should run in the user context (not as a root daemon). This typically means a **Launch Agent** (placed in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` for a specific user or in `/Library/LaunchAgents/` for all users). A LaunchAgent runs when the user logs in and can display UI or use GUI automation. In contrast, a LaunchDaemon (running as root) could detect the hardware but would not be able to control the UI (no access to the WindowServer session by default). So, plan to use a LaunchAgent that starts at login.

* **Language/Tool:** If you're comfortable with Swift or Objective-C, consider building a small menu-bar app or a command-line tool that uses the **CoreGraphics callback** for display changes. This can be a lightweight daemon (no UI needed, except maybe a status icon). Using Swift, you can register the CGDisplay callback as shown above and integrate with the main run loop easily. The callback can then run the logic to launch or quit the app. Alternatively, a continuously running **Python script** with PyObjC could achieve similar results (by calling CoreGraphics APIs or by using `NSWorkspace.didActivateScreen` notifications, if available). AppleScript alone isn't sufficient for event-driven detection, so if not using a compiled program, something like a **Hammerspoon config** might be the next best thing (since Hammerspoon is essentially a ready-made daemon with Lua scripting and can call AppleScripts or shell commands on events).

* **Integration with LaunchAgent:** Whichever solution, wrap it in a LaunchAgent plist so it starts automatically. For example, `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.yourname.xrautostart.plist` can keep it running. Use `KeepAlive=true` so it relaunches if it crashes. If using a scripting language, you might simply point the LaunchAgent to run a shell script or Python script at load.

* **Device Matching vs Always Running:** You have two design choices:

  1. **Always-running agent:** The agent runs continuously and listens for events (display or USB) to fire. This is simpler to implement (no special launchd event config needed) – you just handle events in code.
  2. **On-demand launching:** Utilize launchd's ability to start your script **only when the device is connected**. This would mean using the `LaunchEvents > com.apple.iokit.matching` key in the plist with the headset's vendor/product as discussed. Launchd could start your script when it sees the glasses. However, you would then need a way to also detect disconnection – typically that means your script must remain running after launch and monitor for the removal, or you use a separate launchd event for removal (which is tricky; launchd has device attach events but not direct detach events without an XPC handler). For maintainability, the always-running approach with a single agent handling both connect and disconnect in logic is usually easier.

* **Use Defensive Coding:** Whichever route, make sure to implement the race-condition handling as discussed (debounce, state checks). Also, log events to a file for debugging (so you can see if it detected a connect/disconnect and what actions it took). You can simply use `echo "$(date) - Glasses connected"` >> \~/xrservice.log in shell, or NSLog in Swift, etc., to leave a trace.

* **Clean Exit and System Resources:** When the agent quits (e.g., at logout or shutdown), it should remove any observers or callbacks (e.g., if you used CGDisplayRegisterReconfigurationCallback, pair it with CGDisplayRemoveReconfigurationCallback on exit). This prevents any dangling handlers. If using AppleScript UI scripting, ensure the scripts don't remain hung. In practice, since the agent will run continuously until logout/shutdown, this isn't a big concern, but it's good practice.

* **Testing:** Test the automation thoroughly:

  * Plug in the glasses => SpaceWalker should auto-launch and start the XR session without any manual click.
  * Unplug the glasses => SpaceWalker should shut down within a second or two.
  * Try plugging in when SpaceWalker is already running (shouldn't launch a second instance or should ignore the event).
  * Try unplugging and re-plugging quickly (the app might quit and relaunch appropriately, but without orphaned processes).
  * Also test normal quitting of SpaceWalker (if user quits manually with glasses still connected, maybe your script should detect the app closed and not try to quit it again on disconnect event that already effectively occurred when app closed – this can be an edge case: if user quits app first, then unplugs glasses, your script might attempt to quit the app not realizing it's already closed. A simple check `if SpaceWalker is running` before quitting helps).

* **Maintenance:** Keep the solution as simple as possible. The fewer moving parts (external dependencies or complex daemons), the less likely it will break with OS updates. The CGDisplay callback method is using macOS's native API that's been stable for years, so it's likely to continue working across OS 15.x updates. If Apple significantly changes display handling in the future, you might need to adjust, but that's a reasonable risk.

In terms of maintainability, a **Swift/Objective-C based LaunchAgent** is probably the most robust long-term. It directly interfaces with system APIs for events and can perform the UI click via AppleScript or Accessibility APIs internally. If you prefer a no-compilation route, a combination of Hammerspoon (for event trigger) and AppleScript (for UI) is fairly maintainable too – Hammerspoon is open source and updated for new macOS versions regularly, and your Lua config would be short (just watching `hs.screen.watcher` and calling an AppleScript or shell command).

Lastly, document your setup for future reference. For example, note the device IDs used, and any special permissions required (Screen Recording permission for SpaceWalker, Accessibility permission for the automation script, etc.). This ensures that if you set this up on a new Mac or after an OS upgrade, you can reapply the permissions and settings easily.

By following these guidelines, you'll have a background service that seamlessly launches SpaceWalker and begins your XR session when you don the Viture Pro XR glasses, and shuts it down when you unplug – making the experience truly plug-and-play.
